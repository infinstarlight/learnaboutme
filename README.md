# Hi, I'm Eduardo Valencia. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a game designer, musician and writer. I'm a mostly self-taught programmer with a background in C++, C#, and Java. In 2018, I graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor's degree in Game Design. I primarily focus on combat and ability system mechanics, as well as user experience and other related front-end development.
